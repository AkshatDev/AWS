Every AWS account comes with IAM, it also has its own database, it is secure across all AWS regions.

## 3 Types of identity objects

1. [[IAM Users|Users]] - 
	Identities that represent humans or applications that need access to your account.
2. [[IAM Groups|Group]] -
	Collection of related users e.g. development team, finance or HR.
3. Role - (Hard to understand)
	Can be used by AWS Services, or for granting external access to your account.

Users VS Role

USERS ARE USED WHEN WE CAN IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL THING THAT WILL LOG INTO a service , when number of things are uncertain, for ex, you want to allow 'x' number of EC2 instances access to certain services in your account.

Roles are when you do not know the exact entities are that going to access some resource.
## [[C 1. IAM Identity Policy]]
 IAM let's users to create policies which are objects or documents that can deny or allow access to AWS services **ONLY WHEN** they are attached to users, groups or roles.
