## Public vs Private
**Public**
1. These services are accessed using public endpoints only, eg s3.
**Private** 
1. A private AWS services is something that works inside a [[B 2. VPC]], only things connected to that VPC can access those services.
2. You can attach a Gateway to a VPC for some service in the VPC to be able to access AWS public Zone.
3. **No AWS PRIVATE ZONE CAN ACCESS PUBLIC INTERNET ZONE DIRECTLY**, the communication happens through AWS PUBLIC ZONE.

Can AWS private zone services connect directly with the public internet.
?
No, all the services have to use AWS Public Zone Endpoints.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

### **AWS Region**

1. A region in context of AWS does not map onto a continent or a country. It is a creation of AWS, inside this region is full deployment of AWS infrastructure.
**PROS**
1. Geographical Separation - Isolated Fault Domain.
	1. If a fault occurs in one region, it will not affect other regions.
2.  Geopolitical Separation - Different governance. 
	1. Depending on the region, you will be affected by the laws and regulation of that country.
	2. If you store data in one region, then unless you configure it, it won't leave that region.
3. Location Control - You can pick a region as close to your customers to have maximum data transfer speed and availability.
We can refer to a region using REGION CODE or REGION NAME, typically CLIs and APIs use REGION CODE.
Console UI uses REGION NAME

### **AZs**
Lower lever Architecture Zones. Inside **regions** AWS provides multiple availability zones.
If one availability zone inside a Region fails, all the other zones are not affected by it.

### **AWS Edge Locations**

1. AWS cannot create more AWS Regions faster because it takes a lot of resources and the county's political permissions, for this reason they have AWS Edge Locations.
2. AWS Edge Locations are smaller than AWS Regions and the provide content distribution services. 
3. These are important for companies like NETFLIX, they want to store their data as close as possible to their consumers for fast services. So, Netflix could use a Region in a country but use a different edge location closer to the consumers in different cities.
### **Global services**
Some services are not dependent on regions, eg IAM or Route53.
### **Service Resilience**
1. Global resilient services
	1.  A service that operates globally with a single database, it's one product and it's data is replicated inside multiple regions. This means that any region could fail but it wont affect a global service. It would take the world to fail for a globally resilient service to face outage, eg IAM
2. Region Resilient services
	1.  Services operating inside a single region with one set of data per region. They generally replicate data to different AZs in that region. So, if the whole region fails then the service will fail.
3. AZ resilient services
	1. These services are run for a single availability zone. Generally AZ resilient services are very prone to fail.

## Cheat Sheet — Resilience Levels (simple English)

## Availability-Zone–resilient (Multi-AZ, **within one Region**)
- **What it survives:** Loss of **any one AZ** in that Region.
- **When it fails:** If the **entire Region** goes down (or multiple AZs you rely on fail at once).
- **How to build it:** Run your app in **≥2 AZs** (subnets in different AZs), put an **ALB/NLB** in front, use **Auto Scaling**, and use **Multi-AZ** databases.
- **Notes:** You **don’t need all AZs** in the Region—two is enough to tolerate one-AZ failure. Ensure the remaining AZ can handle the load.
- **Examples:** ALB + EC2 Auto Scaling across 2 AZs; RDS **Multi-AZ**; S3/DynamoDB are already multi-AZ by design (but still regional).

## Region-resilient (Multi-Region)
- **What it survives:** Loss of an **entire Region**.
- **When it fails:** If **all Regions** you use are down, or your global routing/replication plan breaks.
- **How to build it:** Duplicate the stack in **≥2 Regions** and **replicate state**:
  - Data: **S3 CRR/Multi-Region Access Points**, **DynamoDB Global Tables**, **Aurora Global Database**, or cross-Region replicas.
  - Traffic: **Route 53** health checks + failover policies, or **Global Accelerator**.
- **Notes:** Stateless tiers can be active-active; stateful tiers need careful replication and failover.

## Globally-resilient (AWS-managed global services)
- **What it survives:** Individual **Region** outages (AWS runs them across multiple Regions globally).
- **When it fails:** Very rare, provider-level/global control-plane issues.
- **How to use:** You don’t architect them; you **consume** them.
- **Examples:** **Route 53**, **CloudFront**, **IAM**, **STS**, (global endpoints).

### Quick sanity rules
- **Single-AZ** = not resilient to AZ loss.  
- **Multi-AZ (same Region)** = AZ-resilient.  
- **Multi-Region** = Region-resilient.  
- **Global AWS services** = resilient by AWS, but your **origin app** still needs AZ/Multi-Region design if you want higher resilience.
