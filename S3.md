## Basics
- Global Storage Platform - regional based/resilient. During creating an S3 instance, you do not have to select a region, only when you create  things inside an S3 you have to select a region.
- Public service, it runs from the AWS Public zone, unlimited data & multi-user usage. Millions of users can access.
- Perfect for hosting data like audio, vidoe, lard data sets.
- Economical & accessed VIA ui/cli/api/http
- It contains data in form of Objects & Buckets.
### Objects
- We can think of them like files and conceptually most of the time they are interchangeable.
- An object has a key and value.
- If you have object key and bucket then you can access the object value.
- **Remember, by default, even for public services, there is no access in AWS initially, you have to set it up.**
- An object could be from 0 bytes to 5TB.
- Objects also have Version ID, Metadata, Access Control, Sub resources.
### Buckets
- Created inside a specific AWS region.
- Data never leaves that region unless configured to, this ensures data sovereignty.
- Blast Radius is a region.
- Bucket name is Globally Unique, no one can use duplicate bucket names through out the world.
- Buckets can hold unlimited number of objects and an object could be of 0 bytes to 5TB, this makes S3 and infinitely scalable system.
- S3 is a flat structure, it is not a complex structure. All objects in a buckets are stored in the same level. It is not like a file system. Everything is stored in the buckets at the same level.
- Even the UI displays folder like structure inside S3 but it should be notes that S3 is a flat structure.
- Objects are sometimes represented in a way that it looks folder like structure , e.g /old/pic.jpeg , but in reality is just a key that maps to a value and this is useful to accommodate data for different clients in a single S3 bucket.
