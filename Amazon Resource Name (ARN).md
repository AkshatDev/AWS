ARNs are used to uniquely identify resources on AWS accunts.

ARNs, or Amazon Resource Names, are a standardized way of identifying AWS resources across the platform. Each ARN uniquely identifies a specific resource, making it easier to specify which resource an action or policy refers to in various AWS services.

ARNs can use **wildcards** in certain parts, particularly when they are used in IAM policies to specify permissions for **groups of resources**. This feature allows for more flexible and efficient management of permissions across multiple resources.
### Structure of an ARN

An ARN has the following general format:

```
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id
```

Here's what each part represents:

1. **arn**: This simply indicates that the string is an ARN.
2. **partition**: This refers to the larger partition in which the resource is located. The most common partitions are `aws` for global AWS resources and `aws-cn` for China regions.
3. **service**: This specifies the AWS service to which the resource belongs (e.g., `s3` for Amazon S3, `ec2` for Amazon EC2).
4. **region**: This identifies the AWS region in which the resource resides. For global resources like IAM, this field can be empty.
5. **account-id**: This is the AWS account ID without hyphens that owns the resource. It helps in uniquely identifying the resource across accounts.
6. **resource-id**: This is a service-specific identifier for the resource. It can be a simple name or a path (like an instance ID, a bucket name, or a more complex path).

### Examples of ARNs

Here are a few examples of ARNs for different types of AWS resources:

- **Amazon EC2 instance in the US West region**:
  ```
  arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0
  ```
- **An Amazon S3 bucket**:
  ```
  arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
  ```
- **An IAM user**:
  ```
  arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/JohnDoe
  ```

### Use Cases for ARNs

ARNs are used extensively in AWS for various purposes, including:

- **Access Control**: They are used in IAM policies to specify which resources a policy applies to. This is crucial for fine-grained access control.
- **AWS Service Integrations**: Many AWS services require you to specify ARNs when configuring service interactions. For example, when setting up logging for AWS Lambda, you might need to provide the ARN of an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon CloudWatch log group.
- **AWS CLI and SDKs**: When using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or any of the AWS SDKs, ARNs provide a way to programmatically manage specific resources.

Here are the main ways wildcards can be used in ARNs:

1. **Single Wildcard (`*`)**: Represents any number of characters (including zero characters) at the position it is used. For example:
    
    - `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*` - Represents all objects within `my-bucket`.
    - `arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/*` - Applies to all EC2 instances in the `us-west-2` region for the account `123456789012`.
2. **Wildcard at Various Levels**: Depending on the specificity needed, wildcards can be used at different levels of the ARN:
    
    - `arn:aws:s3:::*` - Applies to all S3 buckets in the account.
    - `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/*` - Applies to all IAM users in the specified AWS account.
