### Root User vs IAM Admin in AWS

- **Root user** is created when the AWS account is created.  
- It is **outside IAM** and cannot be deleted or restricted.  
- Root always has **full access + special account-level privileges** (billing, closing account, changing root email, etc.).  
- **IAM users/roles** are managed *within IAM*.  
- Attaching **AdministratorAccess** to an IAM user gives *near root* rights, but:  
  - Some actions are **root-only** (e.g., closing account, changing payment methods, enabling/disabling IAM billing access).  
- ðŸ‘‰ Root is **God-mode**; IAM admin is **almost everything except account ownership**.
